# üîí Access Level Improvement Analysis

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **AuthContext Missing Organization Feature Validation**
- Users can access features even if disabled at organization level
- No validation of organization-specific feature enablement
- Missing checks for feature availability in user's organization

### 2. **Inconsistent Permission Checking**
- Some components bypass organization feature checks
- Role hierarchy not properly enforced in all scenarios
- Missing validation for cross-organization access

### 3. **Server-Side Access Control Gaps**
- Organization feature validation missing in middleware
- Insufficient validation of user organization membership
- Missing checks for organization-specific data access

### 4. **UI/UX Access Feedback Issues**
- No visual indicators for disabled features
- Users can attempt actions they don't have permission for
- Unclear error messages when access is denied

### 5. **Data Isolation Concerns**
- Potential for cross-organization data leakage
- Missing organization context in some API calls
- Insufficient validation of organization ownership
